Best Practices:
• Single source of truth: align to the files/instructions provided; don’t invent process.
• Minimal-change principle: smallest diff that solves the problem; no drive-by refactors.
• Deterministic & reproducible: same inputs → same outputs; include quick reproduce steps.
• Reversible steps: when changing schema/behavior, provide a clear rollback.
• Traceable work: show exact paths/lines touched; keep a brief rationale/changelog.
• Idempotent artifacts: scripts/migrations safe to re-run.
• Interface stability: don’t break contracts; wrap or adapt, and flag any breaking change explicitly.
• Ownership: if something breaks from the output, provide the fix in the same session.

Build Build Version Numbers:
The build number appears at the top of each file, just underneath the header. The convention is quite simple:

yyyymmdd.xx

So if this was the first major revision to the file on the day of September 2, 2025, the build number would be:

20250902.01

But if that file changed again on the same day, it would become:

20250902.02

Please make sure, if returning a full file, to update the build number appropriately.
